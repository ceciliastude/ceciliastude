  - This project was part of the course ***Program Development and Project Handling***, where me and 3 other classmates were tasked to work with Mariehamns Stad to create a website that shows how the taxes you pay with-in the Mariehamn town gets distributed to various services using a simple visual pie chart and detailed break down information tabs that go more in-depth.
  - I was in charge of the API data visualization by making columns, piecharts and other visualization test to see what the capabilities of the Svelte framework were. I was also in charge of making custom icons for each description used to describe the tax distribution.
  - The website after it was finished was handed over to the local municipality government for them to use it as they please , as we were not tasked to host the website our selves so we only ran dev environments with it .
    
    #### 🛠 Software/Tools:
      - SvelteKit for frontend development
      - Visual Studio Code
      - Tailwind CSS
      - ECharts for data visualization

  - AstroTrack is a multi-purpose mobile app where you can keep track on NASA's latest content including the Astronomy Picture of the Day, real-time tracking of the International Space Station (ISS), Mars Rover photos and Near Earth object data - all in one place. Utilized by NASA's & Open Notify's API.
  - This app is developed as part of the ***Cross-platform Mobile Applications*** course project at Åland University of Applied Sciences. The project's development duration was from 22.4.2025-14.05.2025.
  - I was in charge of building the ISS Tracking screen and the Mars Curiosity Rover screen as well as the general layout.
  - As our development duration was limited, our main goal was to showcase as much features as we wished to visualize with NASA's API. We agreed to a much simpler UI this time. 
    
      #### 🛠 Software/Tools:
      - Visual Studio Code
      - JavaScript
