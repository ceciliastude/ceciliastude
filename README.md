  ## 💬 Ongoing Projects:
  
  ### 🎈 Artes All-Star Party 🎈

  - Artes All-Star Party is my examination project; a 3D party game developed in Unity with C# inspired by the ***Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games*** franchise.
  - The game will feature 3 minigames, based on racing, fighting and rhytm games. It will also feature 8 characters, with their own unique skillsets and will be aligned based on ***Power, Speed, Skill and All-Around*** types.
  - The game is currently still in it's early stages but an open beta will launch during autumn 2025.

### 🦊 Project Yokai (Placeholder name) 🦊
  - Project Yokai is a 2D RPG game developed as part of the ***Object-Oriented Programming 2*** course, where we were tasked to create a software application in applications like IntelliJIDEA, Visual Studio, etc.
  - The game features our main character Maaya, who heads to her towns local shrine to pray for guidance by the Fox Yokai on how to help her village overcome the upcoming winter. The player will solve puzzles, perform quests and fight evil spirits who lurk in the forests of the Yokai shrines.  
  - The game is currently on hiatus, as I am currently developing my examination project. The hiatus will end after I am finished with my studies.
